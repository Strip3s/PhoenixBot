# Phoenix Bot
[Support Discord](https://discord.gg/HTkyqD2bkX)<br/><br/>
Phoenix Bot is inspired by Natewong1313's Bird Bot project yet due to lack of activity by their team. We have decided to revive this project to achieve a common goal. Due to the recent insurgence of botters/scalpers taking advantage, our goal is to enable everyone the ability to combat these botters/scalpers by implementing their own botting system. Currently, this auto-checkout bot will support Walmart and Best Buy. There are more plans for future implementations later on. 

* Easy to use interface built on PyQt5
* Waits for items to restock if they are out of stock
* Optional price checker
* Lighting fast auto-checkout
